This guide provides a minimal configuration to set up a React project using TypeScript and Vite, with support for HMR (Hot Module Replacement) and ESLint rules.

Available Plugins
Two official plugins are available to enhance your Vite setup:

@vitejs/plugin-react
Utilizes Babel for Fast Refresh functionality.

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc
Leverages SWC for Fast Refresh, providing faster builds.

Improving ESLint Configuration
For production-grade applications, enhancing the ESLint configuration is highly recommended to enable type-aware linting rules. Follow these steps:

1. Update parserOptions
Modify the parserOptions at the top level to include the following:

js
Copy
Edit
parserOptions: {
  ecmaVersion: 'latest',
  sourceType: 'module',
  project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
  tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
},
2. Adjust TypeScript Rules
Replace the extends entry plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended with one of the following:

plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked
Enables more thorough type-aware checks.

plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked
Activates stricter linting rules for better type safety.

You can also include:

plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked for enforcing stylistic consistency.
3. Add React-Specific Linting
Install the eslint-plugin-react package.
Then, extend your configuration with React-specific rules:

Add plugin:react/recommended for general React linting recommendations.
Include plugin:react/jsx-runtime for linting JSX syntax with the automatic runtime.
With these adjustments, your project will benefit from stricter linting, improved type checks, and better React-specific code quality enforcement.

 To install dependencies:

bun install
To run:

bun run index.js
This project was created using bun init in bun v1.1.18. Bun is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
